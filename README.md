# Mapping Geographic Data in R

Workshop materials for the "Mapping Geographic Data in R" workshop given by Joy Payton as part of ODSC East, held in Boston in spring 2019

## Scripts

Scripts are provided as R Markdown documents and should knit without problems as they pull data from online sources.  In the case of unforeseen problems (a federal government shutdown, connectivity problems), versions of these data are also saved in the [Data](/Data) portion of this repo.
